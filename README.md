# Post-Pandemic Resilience and Growth: Evaluating the Impact of the Nano Enterprise Financing Fund (NEFF)

## Overview
This repository contains the replication files, code, and documentation for research examining the causal effects of graduation loan support on nano-enterprises in rural Tamil Nadu following the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Research Objective
**Estimate the causal effect of graduation loan support on nano-enterprise performance, investment behavior, and business practices using natural experimental design and difference-in-differences estimation.**

## Data
The study leverages primary survey data from nano-enterprises across multiple villages in Tamil Nadu, collected as part of the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project (TNRTP) evaluation.

## Methodology
- **Design:** Natural experimental approach leveraging variation in NEFF program rollout
- **Estimation:** Difference-in-differences and OLS
- **Software:** Stata (primary), R (supplementary)
- **Sample:** Rural nano-enterprises across Tamil Nadu villages

## Data Access
The raw survey data contains sensitive information about individual enterprises and is not publicly available. 

## Replication Instructions
1. Ensure Stata 16+ is installed
2. Run analysis scripts in the Code/ folder in sequence
3. Processed datasets and results will be generated in respective folders
4. All figures and tables are output to the Scratch/ folder
